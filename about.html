<p style = "font-size:20">It was in September of 1996 that Vaani Dance Academy first opened its doors in the Island Lakes area. Prior to that,
 Angele Lavergne, the school's director, had been teaching ballet & creative dance to Francophone students in the Saint-Boniface area in a studio
 located in St-Philip's church. This first school was called Ecole de Danse Classique, and had already been in existence since 1976.<br>

Ecole de Danse Classique was originally founded by Genevieve Montcombroux. After her involvement with the world-famous Opera de Paris in France, 
Genevieve Montcombroux very much wanted to continue her love of ballet when she moved to Canada. Angele Lavergne was one of her first students at
 Ecole de Danse Classique, and she was to learn the art of ballet from Montcombroux for years to come. When Angele completed many years of study,
 Genevieve Montcombroux offered her a position as the school's director in 1990.<br>

Vaani Dance Academy wanted to offer families and the community a more beautiful, upscale, professional and inspiring facility. In September 2016, 
the school relocated to a beautiful 8000 sq. ft. building custom designed to accommodate a state-of-the-art dance school.
